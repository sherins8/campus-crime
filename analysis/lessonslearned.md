Lessons Learned:
 I Learned a lot through this project. First, I looked at the difference between crime rates between May 2022 and May 2023. I found that while this data fluctuated throughout the month, overall, there has been less crime in the month of May in the year 2023. With further exploration, it would be nice to look into whether this is just due to chance or if there were any implemented procedures that allowed this decrease to occur. Second, I looked at accidents on Franklin Street between May 2022 and May 2023 to analyze two things. First, I wanted to look at if there were any locations on Franklin Street with more congregated/clusters of accidents, and second, I wanted to see if there were less accidents this year compared to last year. To my surprise, there wasn't any single location on Franklin Street that exhibited a lot more accidents than other spots of the street (I expected there to be a lot more data at the Franklin Street and Columbia intersection). However, there was a lot less accidents in the year 2023 compared to the year 2022. Lastly, I looked at the gaps between the end of each case and the report date and found that there is an average time gap of 1.48 days between the end of each case and when it was reported. Also, when filtering the data to see which cases have a gap of more than this average, most of these events happened to be Incidents, rather than Accidents or Arrests. The last thing I learned was that it would have been more useful if I just requested my data from the start, rather than waiting until after scraping the data
